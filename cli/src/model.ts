// What the CLI is, stated once so every command inherits it.
//
// The commands used to grow one at a time, and it showed: `keys` was a
// group with a sub-verb, `seed` took a bare positional, the rest were flat
// verbs, and the parser was positional-only — so a command needing two
// arguments had to be special-cased. Three shapes for three commands, and
// each new one had to invent a fourth.
//
// There are exactly two shapes now, and the line between them is not a
// style preference:
//
//   memcell <verb>                 acts on THIS machine or THIS directory
//   memcell <resource> <verb> …    acts on something a memcell holds
//
// A bare verb has nothing to name because its subject is where you are
// standing — `login` is this machine, `connect` is this directory. Everything
// else names the resource it touches, and that name is the same word the
// API path uses and the app route uses. So a verb that cannot say which
// resource it acts on is the signal that the resource model is short one,
// rather than an invitation to name it something.
//
// The two pairs are true inverses, and they are inverses of DIFFERENT
// things:
//
//   login   ⇄ logout        this machine ⇄ an account
//   connect ⇄ hook remove   this directory ⇄ a space, with an agent key
//
// `hook remove` undoes the wiring `connect` made; the key it minted is
// revoked with `agents revoke`, by id, which is why the mint records one.
