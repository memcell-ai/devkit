// Forget what memcell keeps here — on this machine, and in this directory.
//
// The machine half: the session, the keys, the settings, the hook log. The
// directory half: the connection this folder holds and the hooks in it, when
// reset is run somewhere connected. So reset in a project cleans that project
// too, rather than leaving its hooks firing against a key that is gone.
//
// TWO THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, and says so:
//
//   The keys stay live. A key is a credential on the instance, not here;
//   forgetting a copy of it locally leaves it working for anybody who has
//   another copy. Revoking is a different act — `memcell agent`.
//
//   Hooks in OTHER directories stay. It only unwires the one it is run in,
//   because it only knows that one. The rest fire, find no key, and do
//   nothing — quietly, because a hook that talks is worse than one that is
//   quiet.
//
// It asks before it acts. `--force` skips the question, for a script.
