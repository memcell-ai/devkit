//
// Three verbs, and they are about the agent rather than about memcell:
// directives it followed, acts memory stopped, and directives it went against having
// already gone against them once.
//
// Signed in it counts your space; signed out it counts the instance, which
// is the same reading the landing page shows a stranger — so somebody who
// has not signed up yet can run this and check the numbers on the page
// against the instance that served them.
//
// Which of the two you got is said out loud. The figures look alike, and
// inferring the scope from the size of them is how "my agents did nothing
// this week" turns out to have been the whole instance all along.
