// credential store, the machine settings, the session notes, the hook log.
// That was fine until something had to know the whole of it: `reset` built on
// five private answers forgets five things and leaves the sixth, and the
// sixth is whatever the next module invents.
//
// So the directory is named here, once, and what lives in it is a list. A new
// file goes in that list or `reset` will not know about it, which is a thing
// a test can check rather than a thing to remember.

 *
