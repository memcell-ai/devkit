// What every adapter shares — and the principle the whole layer stands on:
// an adapter owns EVERYTHING memcell knows about one agent. How its hooks
// are installed and verified, how memcell's answer is spoken back in its
// dialect, and how its session record is read. Nothing outside an adapter
// switches on an agent's name: a new agent is one file and one registry
// line, and an agent that changes its config or its record format is one
// file touched. Every claim in an adapter carries its verification
// status: driven live, or documented-but-not-yet-driven, stated where the
// claim is made.
//
// Hooks carry no secret — the command is a frozen string and the key is
// read at runtime from the machine keyring — so they live project-side,
// where committing them is a feature: a teammate who clones gets the
// wiring and only needs their own key.
