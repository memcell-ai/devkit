// What one agent's harness CAN do, declared rather than inferred.
//
// This replaces a `Record<Moment, string>` per adapter — a map from one of
// memcell's moments to one event name. That shape carried a name and nothing
// else, so everything that actually differs between harnesses (whether the
// event takes a matcher, what its stdin looks like, how a reply reaches the
// model, whether it can refuse) lived as ad-hoc code somewhere in the
// adapter, where nothing could compare it against the next one.
//
// It had a worse fault. A missing key meant BOTH "this harness cannot" and
// "we never wired it", and those are opposite facts. Reading absence as
// incapacity is how thirteen harnesses that all document a pre-act event
// came to be described as four that do — the map was read as a declaration
// about the agents when it was only ever a declaration about us.
//
// So a capability is never absent here. It is either declared with how, or
// declared UNSUPPORTED WITH A REASON, and the reason has to be about the
// harness rather than about our backlog. The type will not let the question
// go unanswered.
