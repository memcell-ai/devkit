// reader lands here and nothing else moves. Notably: Devin Local dropped
// its predecessor's persistent memories outright — recall injection is the
// whole point of wiring it.

 * outlives whichever agents exist. Naming which of THIS agent's tools count
 * as sending is knowledge about one harness, and this is the file allowed to
 * hold it.
 *
 * `change` is the same set the capture side already learned — one list, so
 * the two halves cannot drift into disagreeing about what a write is. A tool
 * nobody verified is left out: that act goes unguarded, which is silence
