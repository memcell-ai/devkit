// THE FIRST AXIOM, above everything: this fails open, always. It runs inside
// somebody's coding session, between them pressing enter and their agent
// answering. If memcell is down, slow, unreachable or wrong, the right
// behaviour is to say nothing and let the session continue. A memory service
// that can break an agent is worse than no memory service, and it only has
// to happen once for the hooks to come out. Every path here exits 0.
//
// THE SECOND AXIOM: the hook ships and connects, it never judges. It hands
// the turn's transcript delta to `remember` and the memory engine distills what was durable;
// it reports an outcome only where the memory itself said the turn
// corroborated a memory. Deciding "was that worth keeping" or "did that
// help" on the client would be guessing with somebody's record.
