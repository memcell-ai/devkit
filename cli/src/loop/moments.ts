// The lifecycle hooks an agent harness can fire at, and which pipeline phase

//
//   session start · prompt submit → recall.   What is already known has to
//     reach the agent BEFORE it acts, or it acts without it.
//   turn end                      → remember. What the turn produced is
//     handed over as transcript delta; the memory engine distills what was durable.
//   turn end · session end        → report.   A memory the turn's own
//     work corroborated is one the recall got right, and saying so is the
//     only thing that moves confidence.
//   before act                    → pre-act guard evaluation. A directive
//     read at the top of a session and needed forty steps later is a directive
//     nobody is holding by the time it applies. This fires before an
//     individual act and evaluates active memories bearing on THAT act. It fires many
//     times a turn, so it costs no call: active memories come down once
//     and the in-memory matching happens locally.
//   after act                     → post-act guidance delivery and failure recovery.
